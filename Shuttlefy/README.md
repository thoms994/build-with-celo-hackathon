#### Project Description
The passenger transport market in Germany is huge. With 82 million people, it's not surprising that there are over 1,000 companies in public transport alone. However, there are problems with the public transport system: long waiting times at the train stations, a lack of flexibility in bus schedules and limited options for carpooling. Adding to these problems, it can be difficult for new businesses to compete with larger, more established companies. That's why we love DeFi!
